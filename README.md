# SocialCrawler

SocialCrawler is a Python-based project that combines web scraping and social media data extraction. It provides a framework and tools to crawl and extract data from social media platforms, allowing users to gather valuable insights and analyze social media trends. The project aims to facilitate social media data collection for research, marketing, and other purposes.

## Features

- Web scraping: Use Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and Scrapy to crawl and extract data from social media platforms.
- Data extraction: Extract various data from social media, such as user profiles, posts, comments, and hashtags.
- Data analysis: Perform data analysis and gain insights from the collected social media data.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/lihuixuan2018/SocialCrawler.git


2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Set up your environment:

- Obtain API keys or access tokens from the social media platforms you want to crawl.
- Customize the crawler settings and authentication in the `config.py` file.

## Usage

1. Customize the crawler settings in the `config.py` file. Set the desired social media platform, target profiles, and data to extract.

```python
# Social media platform
PLATFORM = 'twitter'

# Target profiles
TARGET_PROFILES = ['user1', 'user2', 'user3']

# Data to extract
DATA_TO_EXTRACT = ['profile', 'posts', 'comments', 'hashtags']
Customize the settings based on the social media platform you want to crawl and the specific data you want to extract.

Run the crawler script to start the data extraction process:

python crawler.py
The script will crawl the specified social media platform, extract the desired data, and store it in a structured format (e.g., CSV, JSON).

Perform data analysis on the extracted social media data using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, or Matplotlib. Customize the analysis code based on your specific analysis goals.
